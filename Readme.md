eHo.st is a community-owned image hosting service. This plugin lets you upload images directly from a widget and the context menu on any web page.

New in version 1.2:

* The context menu now also appears page-wide on supported sites such as imgur, Flickr, yFrog, TwitPic and ImageShack.

New in version 1.1:

 * Localised caption, currently only for English and Dutch.
